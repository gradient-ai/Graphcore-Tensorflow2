    "# Training a TensorFlow 2 model on an IPU using Paperspace Gradient\n",
    "\n",
    "These tutorials will show you how to use a TensorFlow 2 model and train it on a Graphcore IPU using the Paperspace Gradient environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this environment, you will be able to learn how to use an IPU in a Jupyter-style notebook and use it to train a Cluster-GCN model on the ArXiv text dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "No user setup is required to train IPU models on Gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, open the `get-started` folder and run `run_cluster_gcn_notebook.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses the [Cluster-GCN model](https://github.com/graphcore/examples/tree/master/gnn/cluster_gcn/tensorflow2) to predict correct topic labels for papers as an example to show how TensorFlow 2 models can be trained with a local dataset on the IPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "More Graphcore IPU examples can be found at their [tutorials](https://github.com/graphcore/tutorials/) and [examples](https://github.com/graphcore/examples/) GitHub repositories."
